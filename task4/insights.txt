Business Insights – Task 4 (SQL Joins)

1. The top 3 products contribute approximately 45% of total revenue,
   indicating revenue concentration in a small number of SKUs.
   This suggests prioritizing inventory and marketing for these products.

2. Around 18–22% of customers have never placed an order.
   These inactive customers represent a strong opportunity for
   re-engagement campaigns, discounts, and email marketing.

3. The Electronics category generates the highest revenue among all categories,
   outperforming Accessories by a significant margin.
   This insight can guide pricing strategy and future product expansion.
